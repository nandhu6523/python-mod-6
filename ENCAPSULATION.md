### ALGORITHM

1. Start the Program.

3. Initialize public data members name and salary.
4. Create an object emp of the Employee class with given name and salary.

        self.salary = salary

    # public instance methods
    
# creating object of a class
emp = Employee('Jessa', 10000)

# accessing public data members
print("Name: ", emp.name, 'Salary:', emp.salary)

# call public method of the class
print("Name: ", emp.name, 'Salary:', emp.salary)
